# Palindrome Checker

### An application that allows users to check if a word, number, or string of words or special characters are a palindrome.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET

## Description

This application allows users to enter a word, number, string of words, or string of special characters to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same both backward or forward. Users can check as many palindromes as they please, and can exit the application when finished.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called `ShapeTracker`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.

## Known Bugs

I would like to add functionality for checking if a phrase with punctuation can be a palindrome. I also want to add a UI that can run outside of the console as well.
